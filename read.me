GSS 2017 Families – Predicting Mental Health
Overview------------------------------------------------------------
This project uses the 2017 General Social Survey on Families (Public Use Microdata File) to explore how demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to self-rated mental health among Canadians.
I use simple descriptive tables and a linear regression model to identify which characteristics are most strongly associated with better or worse self-rated mental health.

Research Question----------------------------------------------------
  What demographic and family characteristics predict Canadians’ self-rated mental health?

Variables used are:

  SRH_115 — Self-rated mental health 

Predictor variables:

  AGEGR10 — Age group 

  SEX — Sex of respondent

  MARSTAT — Marital status
